# MyReads Project
A project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program

Features a bookshelf app that will allow a user to search for books, add books to various 'shelves' based on having read the book, wanting to read the book, or are currently reading the book.
Utilizes React during the building of the app, a Google API to allow for the search, and a client library to maintain the state of the books.

# To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
